# Air Quality Analysis upon UCI dataset from 5 chemical oxide sensors in Italy

This project highlights and utilizes two signal-processing algorithms - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks - upon the UCI Air Quality dataset. The UCI Air Quality dataset is a multivariate time-series dataset which contains hourly measurements from five metal oxide chemical sensors. PCA is used to analyze correlation
structure, reduce noise, and examine low-dimensional representations of the multivariate signals. LSTM is used in which the trained model can predict future sensor values based on a 24-hour window of previous observations.
